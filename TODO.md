#  TODO

1) Fix euclidean rhythm generation10
3) refactor loading state code, classes should have their own load functions
4) option of which beat to start euclidean on
5) equations
6) Delete samples & modifiers
7) Don't crash when devices change 
8) Disabling of modifiers
9) Throw errors/don't allow the user to enter invalid params
10) Modifiers shouldnt modify themselves maybe?
11) Project settings
12) Parameters not saved: Master volume, Sine wave params, Custom patterns
13) On change of euclidean parameters, set preset menu to custom
14) Euclidean on modifiers: each pulse we 'fire' the modifier, performing its tick action regardless of roundedBeat
15) Loading intervals broken
16) Sometimes can't select to modify modifiers
17) Right click on parameter to see which modifiers act on it
18) Highlight parameters changed by modifier modes other than random
19) Collapse modifiers
20) Improve waveform visibility, especially playhead position
21) Give samples + modifiers a minimum width and anything smaller than displays a horizontal scroll bar
22) Perhaps in a similar vein to parameters, samples & modifiers could have 'actions' such as play/fire, next in cycle, etc
